# TIC TAC TOE 

## Overview
This app was created for my second milestone project with The Code Institute where I demonstrate what I have learnt so far on their web development course. It is a interactive front end website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The websites goal is to be intuitive, user friendly, simple to use and fun.

## Features



- The website is a black and white theme with a white background and black text
- There is a table in the centre of the screen with 9 cells, 3 across and 3 down.

- When you hover over the cells in the grid there is a hover effect showing a grey X when it's X's turn and a grey 0 when its 0's turn.

- The X or 0 then becomes black once the user clicks the chosen cell

- A 'blocked' cursor appears over the cells which are already in use when they're hovered over to make it clear that these cells can not be used
- When somebody wins a black background covers the screen and a message appears saying either "X's Win!" / "0's Win!" / "Draw!"
- There is a restart button that takes you to the start of a new game
